# Vehicle Management System

This project is a simple Vehicle Management System implemented in Java. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts, including inheritance and polymorphism, to model different types of vehicles with various engines and manufacturers.

### Development Environment

- Programming Language: Java
- IDE: [SUBLIME TEXT 3]
- Version Control: Git
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Anishaanowar002/HW-2-JAVA

### Project Structure
The project consists of the following classes:
- Engine, CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine, and HybridEngine to represent different engine types.
- Manufacture to store manufacturer information.
- Vehicle as an abstract class with common attributes and an abstract method `showCharacteristics()`.
- Subclasses of `Vehicle`: `ICEV`, `BEV`, and `HybridV`, representing different types of vehicles.

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `Main` class to demonstrate the characteristics of different vehicles.
